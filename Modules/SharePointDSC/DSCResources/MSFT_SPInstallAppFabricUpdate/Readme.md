**Description**

This resource is used to install the AppFabric Updates. The BinaryDir parameter should 
point to the path that AppFabric***.exe is located (not to AppFabric***.exe itself).
The Build parameter should contain the target product version of AppFabric. This module depends 
on the prerequisites already being installed, which can be done through the use of SPInstallPreReqs.
