/*
**Description**

This resource is used to install the SharePoint binaries.
The BinaryDir parameter should point to the path that setup.exe is located (not to setup.exe itself).
The ProductKey parameter is used to inject in to the configuration file and validate the license key during the installation process. 
This module depends on the prerequisites already being installed, which can be done through the use of [SPInstallPreReqs](SPInstallPreReqs).

**Example**

    SPConfigWizard RunConfigWizard
    {
        Ensure               = "Present"
        DatabaseUpgradeDays  = "sat", "sun"
        DatabaseUpgradeTime  = "3:00am to 5:00am"
        PsDscRunAsCredential = $SetupAccount
    }
