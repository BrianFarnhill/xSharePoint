.SYNOPSIS

This resource will be responsible for joining a server to an existing SharePoint farm.
To create a new farm use the [SPCreateFarm](SPCreateFarm) resource on a different server to begin with, and then pass the same database server and configuration database name parameters to the additional servers using this resource.
