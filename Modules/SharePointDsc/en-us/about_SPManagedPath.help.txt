.NAME
    SPManagedPath

.SYNOPSIS

This resource is responsible for creating managed paths associated with a specific web application. 
The WebAppUrl parameter is used to specify the web application to create the path against, and the RelativeUrl parameter lets you set the URL.
Explicit when set to true will create an explicit inclusion path, if set to false the path is created as wildcard inclusion.
If you are using host named site collections set HostHeader to true and the path will be created as a host header path to be applied for host named site collections.

        WebAppUrl      = "http://sharepoint.contoso.com"

        Explicit       = $false

        HostHeader     = $true
