.NAME
    SPOfficeOnlineServerBinding

.SYNOPSIS

This resource will create a binding to an Office Online Server (formerly known as Office Web Apps). 
The DnsName property can be a single server name, or a FQDN of a load balanced end point that will direct traffic to a farm.

NOTE: This resource is designed to be used where all WOPI bindings will be targeted to the same Office Online Server farm.
If used on a clean environment, the new bindings will all point to the one DNS Name.
If used on an existing configuration that does not follow this rule, it will match only the first DNS name it finds in the list of bindings.
